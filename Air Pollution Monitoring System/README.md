# Air-Pollution-Monitoring-System

The idea is to develop a network which can help to rate the air pollution level of a particular place ,i.e, it is good, average or below average. Thus, appropriate measures can be taken for improvement of air quality.
This is just a demo code using random data. The actual data can be fetched by installing wireless sensor networks.
This is mainly the code for the backend as it was a group project and I was responsible to make the backend.

The technologies used are: Google Map APIs, php, javascript, xml and mysql.

To run the code using:
1. Download 'gases.sql' and add it to your database.
2. Add appropriate database information(username,password and database name) to 'db.php' and 'phpsqlajax_dbinfo.php'.
3. Launch 'home.php' on your localhost.

If you press the refresh button the database will get updated and new analysis will appear.
